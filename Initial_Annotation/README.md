This repository contains the commands used to install and run software for the analysis of the blue death feigning beetle long-read genome principal haplotype. 

The main README page shows the overall software pipeline setup. This directory shows how the main output of the annotation software was treated and used before the difficult work of cleaning up the data began.

There are many bespoke scripts that will be useful templates for other genomes. Because large language models can now write python software scripts much more efficiently than humans (hours versus a few milliseconds), most of these scripts were written with the aid of prompts provided to ChatGPT.

The original prompts are included as a comment in the headers of the scripts. Most scripts required a bit of tweaking or debugging but this was usually minor. If a script lacks a lengthy header, then it was likely a very simple python script or was a re-used and modified script.
