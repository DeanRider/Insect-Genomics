The initial annotation used AGAT to repair the files generated by the various structural prediction programs. While those files were able to function in a preliminary run of table2asn, it is clear that they were inadequate for generating a GenBank-ready submission. 

This directory contains the commands and scripts that were used to fix each of the individual annotation output files and combine them, as well as the scripts used to fix the combined 'global' annotation set in gff3 format.

The final discrepancy report was significantly improved and any errors remaining appeared to be acceptable prior to submission to GenBank staff.
